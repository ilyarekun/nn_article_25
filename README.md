# Brain Tumor Detection and Classification using Comprehensive CNN Model

## Overview

This repository implements a **Comprehensive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** for the detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans, following the methodology outlined in the associated research article. The project aims to provide a non-invasive, accurate, and efficient solution for diagnosing brain tumors, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to outperform traditional methods in key metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and precision.

The proposed model addresses the challenges of tumor heterogeneity and the complexity of manual diagnosis by automating tumor classification into categories such as **glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors**, and normal cases.

---

## Datasets

The model is trained and validated on 2 publicly available MRI datasets:

1. **Br35H Dataset**
2. **Figshare Dataset**  
   These datasets include annotated MRI scans of brain tumors across multiple categories (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumorous cases).
